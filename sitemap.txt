NOT AN OFFICIAL SITEMAP
JUST A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT I WANT

* Homepage (introduce the app, pitch it to people - only shown to people who are
  not yet members -- rather no logged in).

* Register / Login page. Look into OAuth2?

* Goal tracking page; main attraction. Make it the home page for people who
  already have accounts?

* Specific user pages. Similar presentation to the home screen, but without the
  ability to change it in any way (unless it is your own).

* Search page to let people look for your page (if it's public)
